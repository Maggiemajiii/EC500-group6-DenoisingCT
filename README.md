# Standard Deviation Noise Maps of CT Scans using UNet and UNet-based Architectures

#### Project Description
The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model that can accurately estimate the standard deviation (STD) map of noise in CT scans. We implemented a UNet model and a UNet-based model in order to reach our goal

#### Team Members
- Avantika Kothandaraman
- Caiwei Zhang
- Long Chen

#### Files in the Repository
1. **UNet_final.ipynb**
2. **RatUNet_final.ipynb** - ThisJupyter notebook containing all code necessary for constructing the RatUNet architecture, processing data, and evaluating the model's performance.

#### Installation
To run both projects, you need to install the necessary Python packages. You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib torch torchvision
```

#### How to Run the Project
To reproduce the results:
1. **Prepare the Environment**: Ensure all required packages are installed.
2. **Data Processing**: Follow the procedures in Sections 1-4 of the notebook for data preprocessing using the UNet structure.
3. **Model Training and Testing**:
   - Execute the notebook from beginning to end to process the data, train the RatUNet model, and evaluate its performance.
   - Adjust parameters as necessary in the notebook to tweak model performance.
